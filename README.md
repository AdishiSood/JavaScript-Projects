# Palindrome_Checker
While going through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification curriculum I had to write a function which checks if a string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing (e.g. mom, dad, racecar, madam).
