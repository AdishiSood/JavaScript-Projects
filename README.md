# JavaScript Projects
While going through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification curriculum I had to write various functions.
So, I decided to take this challenge a bit further and implement a UI for it and dive more into testing. 

## Palindrome_Checker
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing (e.g. mom, dad, racecar, madam). A palindrome checker checks if a string is a palindrome or not. 

## Mobile_Number_Validator
Mobile number validation is the process of checking if a mobile number is accurate. It lets you find out if the mobile number you have for a business contact is active and able to receive calls or not.

## Caesar_Cipher 
The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the Cipher was a ROT1 (rotate by 1 letter), then every a in the message would show up as a b. I have made a ROT13 cipher, it will encrypt your messages by rotating the letters by 13 characters.
