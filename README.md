# JavaScript Projects
While going through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification curriculum I had to write various functions.
So, I decided to take this challenge a bit further and implement a UI for it and dive more into testing. 

## Palindrome_Checker
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing (e.g. mom, dad, racecar, madam). A palindrome checker checks if a string is a palindrome or not. 

## Mobile_Number_Validator
Mobile number validation is the process of checking if a mobile number is accurate. It lets you find out if the mobile number you have for a business contact is active and able to receive calls or not.
